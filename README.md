# Volley 

## Project created with React Native CLI

### Start Up Guide
1) yarn install 
2) react-native run-android or react-native run-ios

### Structure

- Our navigation is managed by React-Navigation. It is currently made up by a single stack navigator which navigates between our 
  Challenge View, Search View, and Battle View.
- Our state is managed by redux with a little help from react-redux to pass data into our Views and Components. 
  Currently, there is only an Auth reducer and a Players reducer with hardcoded data in. 
- There's a utility folder that holds 2 files. One is the function that generated fake user data (we use the faker library to help us)
  and the other is the data generated by that function. This data set will be the one we use in our app.
